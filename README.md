This little script was a challenge put to me by [Ryan Crawford](https://twitter.com/RDCrawford26) while we discussed both the elegant [Bonsai tree generator for terminal by John Allbritton](https://gitlab.com/jallbrit/bonsai.sh/tree/master) and the goofy twitter account [@emojiDNA](https://twitter.com/emojiDNA).
